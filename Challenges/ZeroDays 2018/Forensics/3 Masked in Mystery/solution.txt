The PNG header is all wrong, but seeing the ^ (caret) made me think of XOR.

Xoring the first "row" of bytes (16) with a real PNG header returns CONQUESTCONQUEST.

Seems legit, so let's repeatedly XOR the whole file with CONQUEST and see what's up.

And what do you know... out comes a proper PNG file, flag exposed in plaintext.
