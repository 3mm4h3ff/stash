The capitalised letters in the challenge's title hinted at One Time Pads.

The description of the challenge also talks about a checkerboard.

After some Googling I come across numeric OTPs and Straddling checkerboards.

Decrypting the message amounts to laying out the checkerboard and working the OTP magic.

Note: my initial checkerboard was laid out incorrectly until I got outside help... lol

So first I added each digit of both streams and subtracted 10 if a result was over 10.

The checkerboard helped in pairing together special numbers, in this case 0 and 5.

Everything else was a matter of simple picking of letters from the checkerboard.

The result I got was: "WOW FLAG ISHKHAL DROIO IS  Z R R A"

From there deducing the flag was easy enough, I recognised Khal Drogo and ZRRA == 1337.

I scripted the whole thing because I was too lazy to get out a pen and paper.

Or because I love Python... probably both :P

ZD2018{Khal Drogo is 1337}
