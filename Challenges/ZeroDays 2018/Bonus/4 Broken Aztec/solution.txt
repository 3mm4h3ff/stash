Opening the image Broken_Aztec.png results in an error.

In a hex editor it's easy to spot that bytes 5 to 9 are incorrect for PNGs headers.

Changing the values from 0x73526F636B to 0x0D0A1A0A00 still caused an error.

Reading up about how PNGs are constructed, I figured I had to fix the IHDR's CRC value.

So I wrote a script (fixpng.py) to correct the CRC of the IHDR and all IDAT chunks.

Finally the image could open properly in an image viewer.

Weirdly enough it was just a 1280x16 black image. At this point I got a hint â€“ resize!

So I change the height of the image from the IHDR chunk and set it to 720... better!

Now after fixing the CRC again to "save changes" the real image was revealed.

The guy's sunglasses had an Aztec code, similar-looking to a QR code.

I used Photoshop to enhance the Aztec code, ended up doing it the long way.

Finally, submitting the result to an online barcode reader returned the flag.
