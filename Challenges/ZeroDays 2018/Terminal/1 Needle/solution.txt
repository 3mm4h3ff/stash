SOLUTION 2

All files seem to be the same size, 325 bytes, so first we verify that.

$ wc -c * | sort | awk '{print $1}' | uniq -u
64
3249739

Apparently there is one that's different in size with only 64 bytes.

$ wc -c * | sort | uniq -u | grep 64 | head -1
      64 ZeroDays7235

Lo and behold, the file ZeroDays7235 contains the flag!

ZD2018{I_am_very_good_at_finding_things}
